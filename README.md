# WeWe - Wearing based on the weather üå¶

An API built on Ruby on Rails that provides recommendations for what to wear according to the weather forecast on a specific location.

# Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Assuming that the user knows his location in geographical coordinates (e.g. via mobile phone or web browser), the API provides an endpoint that will show the current weather forecast for the inputted location. Also, and according to that current forecast, it will give recommendations on what type of clothes the user should take.
This solution is making use of an external API to retrieve the current meteorology: [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
